## Trace Kanji - A Japanese Kanji trainer

Start learning [here](https://trace-kanji.vercel.app/)!

An extensive study tool for Japanese learners, specifically in the meanings and stroke orders of over 2000 kanji. Users can login to save specfic kanji to their own created decks, providing an easy way to facilitate their study at their own pace. In-depth information such as the JLPT grade, onyomi and kunyomi readings, and more are provided through KanjiAPI, and stroke orders are retrieved from KanjiVG, a collection of vector graphics.

This project is a work-in-progress.
